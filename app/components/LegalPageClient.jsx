            TeenVerseHub does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the platform. Maintenance, updates, or technical issues may cause temporary unavailability.

            <strong>Compliance Notice:</strong> This section outlines our strict protocols regarding identity verification and DigiLocker usage.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">1. DigiLocker Consent</h4>
          <p>
            By proceeding with verification, you explicitly consent to TeenVerseHub requesting and accessing your government-issued documents (such as PAN or Aadhaar XML, where legally permitted) via DigiLocker, solely for the purpose of identity verification and regulatory compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to DigiLocker is initiated only by the user through an explicit verification request. TeenVerseHub does not access documents automatically or without user action.
          </p>
          <p>
            TeenVerseHub does not store your Aadhaar number or biometric information. Only document references and verification status are stored.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm">
            Where DigiLocker is unavailable, TeenVerseHub may offer alternative lawful verification methods with equivalent consent protections.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">2. Minors and Guardian Verification</h4>
          <p>
            Users below the age of 18 are required to complete verification through their parent or legal guardian. TeenVerseHub does not access or verify government documents of minors directly. Only guardian documents are used for verification and payout eligibility.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">3. Purpose-Limited Use</h4>
          <p>
            Verification is performed only when required for financial actions such as payouts or paid engagements. TeenVerseHub does not perform identity verification at the time of signup.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">4. Data Retention & Audits</h4>
          <p>
            Verification records are retained only as long as required for legal, accounting, or regulatory purposes. Users may request deletion of their data where permitted by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            All verification access is logged with timestamps for audit and compliance purposes.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 italic mt-4 border-t border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 pt-4">
            Verification confirms identity and eligibility for payouts and does not constitute endorsement, certification, or employment by TeenVerseHub.

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">2. Data Usage & Minors</h4>
          <p>
            We strictly limit the visibility of creators' data. Clients only see: First Name, Skills, and Portfolio. 
            <strong>We strictly NEVER sell data to third-party advertisers.</strong>
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">3. Data Retention</h4>
          <p>
            We retain account data for as long as the account is active. Upon deletion request, data is removed within 30 days, except where retention is required by law (e.g., transaction logs for tax audits).

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">2. Settlement Policy</h4>
          <p>
            All payments are processed and held by the payment gateway partner in accordance with their settlement and escrow-like mechanisms. TeenVerseHub does not hold or store customer funds. If a Client does not respond within 7 days of submission, the payment gateway may release the funds to the Freelancer according to its settlement and dispute policies.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">3. Chargebacks & Payment Disputes</h4>
          <p>
            If a payment is reversed due to a bank dispute or chargeback initiated by a Client, TeenVerseHub reserves the right to recover the corresponding amount from the freelancer's balance.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">4. Tax Liability (TDS)</h4>
          <p>
            Freelancers are solely responsible for reporting their income and paying applicable taxes. TeenVerseHub does not deduct TDS at present. TeenVerseHub does not act as an e-commerce operator for the purpose of tax collection at source unless mandated under applicable law.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6">5. GST Status</h4>
          <p>
             TeenVerseHub is currently not registered under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act. If registration becomes mandatory under Indian law, applicable taxes will be charged accordingly.
